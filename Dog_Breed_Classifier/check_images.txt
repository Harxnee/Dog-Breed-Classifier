Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Dog_01.jpg as 'pug'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models have rightly identified the picture as dog as the file name is "dog" and the breed hasn't been identified by all the three

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures identified the object picture as a non-dog, and correctly classified it as a 'coffee'. 

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG and ResNet identified correctly 75% of images. Overall, the best-performing model architecture for this task was ResNet, because of its less runtime as compared to VGG.
